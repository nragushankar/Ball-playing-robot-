LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 – A ROBOT WHICH LOCATES A BALL IN A PLAY FIELD AND SHOOT GOALS
## Aim
•	Construct an EV3 Mindstorms Lego Robot with the kit.
•	The robot should locate balls within a playing field and shoot goals.
•	The aim of this project is to provide experience in designing a mobile robot for a specific task and writing programs to achieve the desired outcome.

## Functionalities

## Task 1  
Penalty Shootout The robot is given a ball and placed in front of the goal facing the back of the field (away from the goal). It is then activated and moves toward the back of the field. When the robot reaches the back wall it turns around, moves to the penalty shootout line (at the half way position) and takes a shot at the goal with the ball. A torch may be used to guide the robot to the penalty shootout position and to line up the shot at goal. The robot must shoot at the goal from that position and is not allowed to dribble the ball toward the goal. Each robot is given 10 penalty shots at the goal and the robot that scores the most goals is considered the winner.

## Task 2 
Ball Finding and Goal Scoring For this task the robot is placed in the centre of the field facing the goal. There are six squash balls. Five are placed in random positions on the field. The user may use a torch to assist the robot to locate the goal and line up goal shots (but not to find balls). The robot that collects the most balls and pushes them through the goal within 5 minutes is the winner. When a goal is scored the ball will be replaced on the playfield in a random position.
Any ball that comes to rest against a wall can be moved 3 cm away from the wall to make it graspable.
